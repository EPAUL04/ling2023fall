            <h3>what is language?</h3>
            <p>language: a distinctive mental capacity of human communication</p>
            <ul>
                <li>varies across groups/individuals but not in random/unconstrained ways</li>
                <li>languages share a common core; unconscious/tacit knowledge</li>
            </ul>
            <p>descriptive rules: describe patterns of grammaticality according to how people use language</p>
            <p>prescriptive rules: claims about how people "should" use language. generally comes froma privileged way of speaking and thinking</p>
            <p>language acquisition: a natural process of learning language that occurs unconsciously without instruction</p>
            <p>language learning: process of conscious knowledge via instruction</p>
            
            <h3 id="lang_vs_comm">how is language different from communication?</h3>
            <p>design features of language: features that distinguish human language from other communication systems, proposed by linguist Charles Hockett</p>
            <ul>
                <li>semanticity: specific signals with specific meanings</li>
                <li>arbitrariness:no logical connection between the signals and the things they represent</li>
                <li>discreteness: made up of smaller repeatable parts rather than indivisible units (note - discrete as in separate, not discreet as in subtle)</li>
                <li>displacement: capable of talking about things not currently present, the past, and the future</li>
                <li>productivity: language users can produce and understand new utterances (again, note - product like production not productive)</li>
                <li>duality of patterning: has a lot of meaningful utterances which can be recombined from a small number of disconnected parts of language 
                    - eg there's a smallish amount of words that can be recombined into a near-infinite number of sentences
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>animal communication systems can have SOME of the design features but never ALL, thus the distinction between human language and animal 
                communication systems . note - remember back to quiz one: animals (even primates) cannot learn human language because they cannot hit all the 
                design features. even primates who can memorize sign languages cannot accomplish the displacement and productivity aspects of language
            </p>
            <p>grammar: a linguistic rule system used to produce/understand sentences (linguistically!!!! grammar has a separate definition to the layman)</p>
            
            <h3 id="in_common">what does all language have in common?</h3>
            <p>universal grammar: the set of linguistic rules common to all languages; thought to be an integral part of human cognition - this goes back 
                to the thing about mistakes not being random. there are impossible mistakes, variation across groups/individuals is NOT random 
            </p>
            <p>linguistic parameters: <b>binary</b> settings of universal grammatical principles proposed to account for differences among languages</p>
            <ul>
                <li>this is different than universal grammar!!! it's more so of like the specific bits of language that make up the idea of universal grammar? 
                    like there are only some ways that languages can form and interact and stuff according to universal grammar and those 'ways' are linguistic 
                    parameters!!! for example, the SVO (subject, verb, object) linguistic parameter is on for English amd off for Japanese; null subject (subject 
                    understood without being pronounced) linguistic parameter is on for Italian and off for French
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="shared_traits">What traits do all languages share?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>have subjects and predicates (girl idk)</li>
                <li>have nouns and verbs</li>
                <li>use subset of sounds from wider possible group of human noises</li>
                <li>similar ways of categorizing meaning distinctions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="chomsky">Noam Chomsky (every linguist's bestie)</h3>
            <p>Noam Chomsky is a prominent figure in linguistic history. he is often credited as the leader of the "Chomskyan Revolution", which involved the 
                introduction of the idea of generative grammar. his work can be traced back to 18th century rational philosophers of the Enlightenment, the work 
                of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, and scholars of the structuralist tradition. for anyone unfamiliar with these terms (me :P), rationalism 
                is the philosophy that we use reason/innate knowledge to navigate the world. scholars of this school of thought incude Rene Descart, Gottfried 
                Leibniz, and Benedict Spinoza and generally appealed to those of a mathematical or geometric spirit. its counterpart, empiricism, is that you begin 
                with no knowledge whatsoever and must gain knowledge via experience. it was favored by John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and David Hume. basically, this 
                is just the entire nature vs nurture thing over again. and as we know from language acquisition and bilingualism, nature won (at least in 
                linguistics). also, if anyone in the world cares, the Ferdinand de Saussure guy was sort of the #inspo for structural linguistics, which is 
                the study of the relationship between words and their meanings (more precisely: signifiers and signified) and how signs get their meanings from 
                structure. 
            </p>
            <p>returning to our boy Chomsky, he also had some thoughts (inspired by de Saussure) on linguistic competence and performance. linguistic competence, 
                also called "langue" (french  for language), is the organizing principles of speech as well as its rules of combination, which are unconsciously 
                existing in your brain. language performance, or "parole" (french for speech), represents the actual sounds you produce with the competence you may 
                have. regardless of your level of competence, you may experience slips of the tongue, mistakes, and poor public speaking if you have poor 
                linguistic performance. although this sounds pointless and dumb it is a real thing and leads to discrimination bc people are sometimes the worst.
            </p>

            <h3 id="micro/macro">Micro- and Macrolanguage</h3>
            <p>microlanguage is a concept that describes the structures inside our individual brains that contain knowledge of what it is to speak English. 
                everything affects your microlanguage - demographics, where you've lived, unique family sayings, workplace jargon, your interests, etc.
            </p>
            <p>idiolect is a similar term referring to your idiosyncratic personal dialect (vocab, pronunciation, meaning, etc)</p>
            <p>macrolanguage is kind of the agreement on a standard language system based on the overlapping microlanguages in an area. agreeing on a 
                defined system of grammar is useful because it allows people to communicate and understand each other easily, but language can also have a 
                negative effect on communities and people. sometimes, having a defined language can exclude or systemically harm people, especially in cases 
                where one group decides how everyone should talk, ignoring the ways everyone other than themselves actually do talk, and then causing people 
                who do not follow the 'rules' of the language exactly to be excluded or discriminated against
            </p>

            <h3 id="animal">Animal Communication</h3>
            <p>many species of animals communicate in ways that replicate certain design features of language, but none of them can properly imitate every 
                design feature, which is why animals are not considered to have 'language'. however, you shouldn't really look at animal communication and 
                human language as a huge, impassible boundary since most animal communication systems are extremely complex and imitate facets of language.
