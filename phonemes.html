            <h3 id="dist">Distribution</h3>
            <p>the distribution of a phone is where it occurs in language. if the distributions of two phones overlaps, they have constrastive distribution.
                phonotactics is the language-specific restrictions of where a phone can occur. if two phones have distributions that never overlap, they 
                have complementary distribution. phones with complementary distributions are ones where there are like rules that dictate when one or the 
                other can be used, like with n and the ng sound. you never say ing with an n sound, or even an n and g sound. its always the ng sound. phones 
                with contrastive distributions may be used in the same ways, and it depends on the specific word to determine which is used. there are even 
                some words where either phone can be used and it will completely change the word. with complementary distribution, you can't have that because 
                it wouldn't change the meaning it would just sound like an error.
            </p>
            <p>minimal pairs are those words where either phone can work but also changes the meaning. for example, if you "paid" /ped/ it means something 
                completely different than if you "peed" /pid/ even though the only difference between the two was a single phone. they are used to help 
                determine whether two phone have complementary or contrastive distribution.
            </p>

            <h3 id="pna">Phonemes and Allophones</h3>
            <p>the reason two phones' distributions being complementary/constrastive matters is because you can either have two phones that are distinct, 
                separate phonemes, or two phones that are allophones of the same phoneme. for example, in english, you can pronounce p in two ways. first is 
                the pronunciation it has in the word lap, which is unaspirated. the second is the way it is pronounced in pal, which is aspirated. this just 
                means that you say it kind of more forcefully with like a little puff of air. now, if you said lap with an aspirated p, it would still make 
                sense and would not change the meaning of the word. unless you were doing that for some specific reason, people might look at you a bit weird 
                because it's just not really how the word is said, but in general they're similar enough that it works!!! this is because they're allophones 
                of the same phoneme /p/. however, in hindi, these two phones are completely separate phonemes. saying one versus the other completely 
                changes a word's meaning!!!
            </p>
            <p>phoneme: the set of pronunciations of a phone / /</p>
            <p>allophone: the individual pronunciations within the set [ ]</p>
            <p>eg the phoneme /t/ has [t] and [É¾] (tap)</p>
            <p>assimilation rule is the idea that one allophone may be chosen over another over various contexts because of the sounds around it, like where 
                in the mouth each sound is made and shifting around to match that better instead of moving back and forth in the mouth or smth.
            </p>
            <p>also wanted to mention that many times, native speakers of a language will have an exceptionally hard time distinguishing allophones, 
                because of language acquisition stuff. as you get very used to/ comfortable with a language, you begin to lose the small distinctions between 
                indiviudal allophones and focus on the sounds used in your language and specifically on the phonemes. we never have to think about what 
                allophone of p we're using, because the phonological rules are unconscious. so we don't really think about whether we're using an aspirated 
                or unaspirated p enough to register the difference, and they just live in our minds as a single p sound!! (probably a letter, since it's 
                a mental grammar thing and we don't really know intrinsically about phonemees and allophones and etc but are taught about letters young!)

                <h3 id="analysis">Phonemic Analysis</h3>
                <p>phonemic analysis is the process of analyzing a language for its phonemes, their allophones, and their distributions</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify/Organize Phones of Interest: search for minimal pairs and organize them</li>
                    <li>Identify Environments of Phones of Interest: create a diagram with phones listed at top and each environment they occur in underneath</li>
                    <li>Determine Overlaps in Environment: if there are overlaps, they're probably different phonemes (eg if you're doing k and p you'll get 
                        environments like s_u for both)
                    </li>                   
                    <li>Simplify the Environments: find patterns of where the phones can and can't appear (after a high vowel, before an onset of a primarily 
                        stressed syllable, etc)</li>
                    <li>Organize Phones Into Phonemes: which phonemes exist?</li>
                    <li>Identify Default Allophone: this is the one you will use to name the phoneme based on which is simpler to type/write, which occurs 
                        more frequently, which has a broader distribution, etc
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <P>the final thing to mention is that you memorize phonemes and the rules that govern allophone pronunciation so you don't actually have to 
                    memorize each individual allophone and its environment, you can just kind of use the phonemes and rules to fill it in in your head when 
                    speaking or something!!!
                </P>
