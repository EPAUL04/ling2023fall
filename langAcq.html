            <h3 id="babble">Baby Babbling</h3>
            <p>babies babble as a sensory-seeking behavior to explore the world around them. they are paying attention to language from birth, and learn to 
                imitate the sounds that they encounter the most. it's important as a parent to expose your child to all the languages you want them to pick 
                up, because it has several key importances. firstly, even d/Deaf babies babble, and when properly exposed to sign language they will babble 
                in signs. since babbling is an important stage in their language development, they need proper exposure to ensure that this stage happens 
                the right way. secondly and relatedly, babies who are raised bi- or multi-lingually need to be exposed to the languages they will be raised with 
                for the same reason. finally, hearing babies are predisposed to picking up on all language sounds, but will begin to lose the ability to 
                distinguish the ones they never hear. exposing your baby to language makes sure they can still hear the right language sounds.
            </p>
            <p>returning to the central idea here: babies are paying attention to language from birth, and are predisposed to be able to pick it up. 
                language acquisition happens naturally and unconsciously.
            </p>
            <h3 id="mistake">Mistakes in Language Learning</h3>
            <p>also, a lot can be learned from the mistakes little kids are making when learning to speak. there are a lot of mistakes they make, but there 
                are some mistakes that are never made. this points to the existence of universal grammar, which is a concept linguistics love that basically means  
                all languages have a few rules they always follow. since there are certain mistakes kids don't make, these 'impossible' mistakes rule out certain
                parts of language and tell us what cannot be a rule of language! most kids' mistakes aren't even random and follow some sort of pattern of the 
                language they're learning, just maybe the wrong pattern/misapplied in the context or something. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="l2">Second Language Learning</h3>
            <p>when learning a second language, people make some of the same mistakes we see children learning their first language make. usually, people 
                apply the rules of their own language to the language they're learning, which can conflict with the actual rules of the language and causes 
                errors. that's why people flip the word order, use the wrong form of a verb, forget articles, or incorrectly pluralize things. it's also why 
                people have accents - because they apply the rules of phonation and the sounds of their native language to the one they're learning. it is 
                important to note that these things are not happening on purpose or even consciously; people are using what they know to try to learn 
                something completely new and different. this is called a transfer effect. finally, all children will eventually pick up a first language of 
                some kind naturally and unconsciously, but there is no guarantee that an adult can pick up a second language. nueroplasticity makes children 
                both predisposed for and very good at learning languages.
            </p>

            <h3 id="benefits">Benefits of Bilingualism</h3>
            <p>for the same reason it is also very easy for babies and children to pick up on and learn a second language, there are also many benefits to it. 
                a commonly cited study (Travis et al 1937) reported that bilingual children had a higher rate of stuttering. the study has been thouroughly 
                disproven and, if i dare say, utterly decimated. instead, it's been proven that bilinguals have several beneficial qualities such as increased 
                ability to multitask and better executive function and stuff. idk it's good and important and etc.
            </p>

            <h3 id="code">Codeswitching</h3>
            <p>codeswitching is a linguistic concept that refers to bi- or multi-linguals switching between languages over a single period of speech. there are 
                a few categories of this. alternational codeswitching is when you are switching between larger parts of speech, usually full sentences or 
                clauses. inter-sentential is when you switch in the middle of the sentence. codeswitching is never random; it's often governed by the rules 
                of one or more of the languages being spoken but can at times have its own rules that make sense within the concept of codeswitching. also 
                important to note is that codeswitching has another meaning outside of linguistics. in linguistics it's a very good thing, outside of 
                linguistics it's a very bad thing: people having to switch to speak a certain way to succeed in certain environments. usually this refers to 
                things like people having to speak in a certain way at work to be considered professional, which usually excludes valid ways of speaking 
                based on racism and discrimination. you already know all of this of course but i'm just saying for note-taking purposes or something.
