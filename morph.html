            <h3 id="morph">What is Morphology?</h3>
            <p>morphology is the study of how words are put together!!! basically the unconscious knowledge of how to put parts of words together into 
                new words. a morpheme is a small part of a word, or more technically; the most basic unit of meaning. words can be either morphologically 
                simple, ie having only one morpheme, or morphologically complex, ie having multiple morphemes.
            </p>

            <h3 id="bnr">Bases and Roots</h3>
            <p>a base is the thing that a morpheme attaches to. bases can be simple or complex, but the simplest base of a word is called a root. perhaps 
                a better definition of a root is the one ginny gave us, which is that a root is the 'kernel' of the word.
            </p>
            <p>some morphemes are bound and must occur in conjunction to a base. for example, the suffix -ing is not its own word. some morphemes are free, 
                and can occur on their own. an example of this is the morpheme tree- in treehouse. since tree is its own word, the tree in treehouse is a 
                free morpheme. there are also bound roots. for example, you can be over- or underwhelmed, but you can never be just 'whelmed' since this 
                root is bound.
            </p>
            <p>there are also compounds, which in the case of morphology refer to words with multiple morphemes where neither morpheme reflects the
                primary meaning entirely on its own. in words like greenhouse, you can't really say either morpheme is the root. it doesn't just boil down
                to a house, because a greenhouse is a building not really related to a house house at all. but it also doesn't boil down to just green,
                because although it contains greenery, that lacks fundamental meaning of the word. compare this to a word like unfortunate, which has a 
                clear root of fortune. you can boil unfortunate down to lacking in fortune or bad fortune in a way you can't do with greenhouse. the 
                difference we're seeing here is actually 'headedness'. the 'head' of a compound determines its lexical category as well as its 
                interpretation in endocentric compounds! compounds that have no head are called exocentric. there are also duanda compounds, which is when 
                the compound is co-headed or exocentric, but also is typically (but not always) made of words that don't exist outside of the compound. for 
                example, zigzag or hocus pocus. they typically mirror each other's sounds. other duanda compounds that have words that do exist outside of 
                the compound are words like bittersweet. either way, they're the less common type of compound.
            </p>

            <h3 id="fix">Affixes</h3>
            <p>affixes are morphemes that specifically attach to words. so like a morpheme can be cat or pre- or -est, and the pre- and -est ones would be 
                affixes!!! there are several types of affixes. there are prefixes and suffixes, which you've likely heard of before.</p>
            <p>there are also infixes, which are affixes that attach to words by going right in the middle of the base anyway. 
                we don't really have these in english; it's pretty uncommon. we do have expletive infixes, however. this is like when 
                fantastic becomes fan-fucking-tastic.
            </p>
            <p>expletive infixes are an interesting linguistic phenomenon because it is also a fun little exercise in stress, as the profanity
                always comes before the stressed syllable. this is an example of a morphophonological pattern, which is a word that is too long and just
                describes how morphemes attach to words. another example of this is the suffix -s to pluralize words, because when -s comes after a voiced 
                phone it is [-s] and if it comes after a voiceless phone it is pronounced [-z], even thought they're allomorphs of the same /-s/ morpheme.
            </p>
            <p>circumfixes are affixes that go around the base. these are also more rare in english. some people say that the "em...en" from words like 
                embolden counts as a circumfix, but this is controversial. 
            </p>
            <p>simultaneous affixes are ones that happen at the same time as a word. these are more for sign or tonal languages typically, and don't 
                really apply to english either.
            </p>

            <h3 id="func">Functionality of Morphology</h3>
            <p>derivational morphology: changes meaning or category of word</p>
            <p>inflectional morphology: expresses grammatical information about the word appropriate to its lexical category </p>

            <h3 id="lex">Lexical Categories</h3>
            <p>we're going to try not to go apeshit with the lexical categories because i'm not sure how to parse out what's important on the final and 
                what isn't, but i have like two full pages of notes on lexical categories</p>
            <div>
                <p>Nouns</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>syntactic: can follow a determiner (an, the, etc), can be modified by adjectives, can be the subject or object of a verb, can be replaced 
                        by a pronoun</li>
                    <li>morphological: have singular and plural forms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Verbs</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>syntactical: can combine with auxiliary verbs (can, have, will, be), can follow the infinitive marker "to", can take an object without a 
                        preposition
                    </li>
                    <li>morphological: have a third person singular present tense plural (-s), have a past-tense form (usually -ed), have a perfect/passive 
                        form (-ed or -en), have a progressive form (-ing)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Adjectives</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>syntactical: modify nouns, can be modified by "very", do not allow noun phrase objects</li>
                    <li>morphological: can be suffixed by -ish most of the time, may have comparitive/superlative forms (-ier, -iest)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Adverbs</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>syntactical: modify verbs/adjectives/other adverbs, cannot appear alone between a determiner and a noun, can be modified by "very"</li>
                    <li>morphological: many end in -ly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 id="selec">Selection</h3>
            <p>selection is the property of derivational affixes to choose which categories they attach to, and to change the category of the word they 
                are attaching to. inflectional affixes do not have this property because they don't change the category
            </p>

            <h3 id="etc">Not Sure How This is Related to Morphemes But Let's Talk About It!</h3>
            <p>reduplication is when a part of a word is repeated to change the meaning, which i guess is some sort of morphological thing. an example of 
                this is how if i "like" you we're probably friends but if i "like-like" you i have a crush on you and am also five.
            </p>
            <p>eponyms are words that originally were brands or proper nouns of some sort and became normal nouns or even verbs. for example, i can "google" 
                something or ask you for a "kleenex" or say i love "victorian" houses.
            </p>
            <p>clipping is when a word is shortened in common speech, like how it is totally correct (if not more so) to say trans than transgender</p>
            <p>a blend or portmanteau is when words are blended together, like how instagram actually comes from instant telegram!</p>
            <p>acronyms are words that come from shortening longer phrases, like how lgbtq is an acronym, or how snafu apparently is the acronym of 
                "situation now all fucked up"
            </p>

            <h3 id="ambig">Structural Ambiguity</h3>
            <p>structural ambiguity is when a word has multiple affixes and the order in which they have been added isn't super clear, like how the word 
                "untieable" could either be [un[tie-able]] or [[un-tie]able]. as you will notice, this creates two separate meanings which is quite typical 
                of words that have structural ambiguity. this is the same thing as compound words that are co-headed that we already talked about!
            </p>

            <h3 id="trees">Morphological Trees</h3>
            <p>i'm quickly learning that linguists fucking love a tree diagram, so we've got morphological trees too.</p>
            <p>the way to construct a morphological tree is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>start with the category of the word as it currently is (eg Adj)</li>
                <li>make your two branches down into the base and morpheme, represented by the category of the base (eg N) and the actual morpheme 
                    (eg -al)
                </li>
                <li>on the branches down from the category of the base, repeat this so you have either two morphemes (eg govern and ment) or a category 
                    and a morpheme
                </li>
                <li>write a funny silly little subscript guy next to the base (eg govern<sub> V</sub>)</li>
            </ul>
        </main>
