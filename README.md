Hi!!!
This is my website with an overview of my notes from fall 2023 linguistics 201!!!
You should be able to access the website by using the url https://epaul04.github.io/ling2023fall/langAcq.html !!!
Currently, the css is not connected to the home page so it does not have the normal stylization,
which I am in the process of trying to fix!!! But it should still work and the rest of the pages have it so 
they should be less ugly :)
