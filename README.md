hi!!!
this is my website with an overview of my notes from fall 2023 linguistics 201!!!
you should be able to access the website by using the url https://epaul04.github.io/ling2023fall/langAcq.html
currently, the css is not connected to the home page so it does not have the normal stylization,
which i am in the process of trying to fix!!! but it should still work and the rest of the pages have it so 
they should be less ugly :)
