            <h3 id="syllables">Syllables</h3>
            <p>syllables, often denoted with the greek letter sigma and separated in notation/transcription by a period, are <strong>peaks in 
                sonority</strong> which is an important definition to remember!!!</p>
            <p>the loudest/most prominent part of the syllable is called the nucleus. the nucleus is typically a vowel, although some languages, 
                including english, have syllabic consonants that can be the nucleus of a syllable. the initial part of a syllable before the 
                nucleus is called the onset. the final part of a syllable after the nucleus is the coda. open syllables have no coda, as opposed 
                to closed syllables. however, a syllable with no onset is just called "onsetless". the coda and onset together can be referred
                to as the margins of the syllable. a complex margin is one that has more than one phone in it/before the nucleus. the nucleus
                and coda can be called the rime. yes, this is where rhyming comes from. 
            </p>
            <p>syllables are also sometimes represented with Vs and Cs in the place of vowel/consonant phones. for example, 
                "barrels" -> /beÉ¹.ls/ -> CVC.CC</p>
            <p>you can use trees to represent and diagram syllables. not going to show it here much but i'm pretty sure you get the idea. it 
                would be like um uh yk like the word and then breaking it into syllables and then breaking that into like the onset nucleus coda 
                and then the individual phones from there.
            </p>
            <p>sonority is an abstract measurement of phone prominence. english words are structured so that the phone with the highest sonority 
                is in the middle more or less, like a syllable's nucleus has the highest sonority because you can't really bounce around between 
                highest and lowest and etc and etc.
            </p>

            <h3 id="stress">Stress</h3>
            <p>primary stress: the syllable with the most prominent stress, marked by an apostrophe/tick mark before the onset</p>
            <p>secondary stress: the syllable with the next most prominent stress, marked by a comma/lower tick mark before the onset, in place 
                of the period
            </p>
            <p>the remaining syllables are not specially marked</p>
            <p>stress can also be marked in non-ipa diacritics, which has a tick mark facing the onset for the primary stress and a tick mark 
                facing the coda for the secondary stress, while unstressed syllables are marked with a breve accent which is the little scoop 
                looking thing. this kind of transcription places the accents/tick marks directly over the nucleus of the syllable rather than 
                before the onset
            </p>
